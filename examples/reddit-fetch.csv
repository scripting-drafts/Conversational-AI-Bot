pics	IMPORTANT PSA: No, you did not win a gift card.	fjn0j9	RamsesThePigeon	Hey, folks!  As some of you may already be aware, certain users are receiving private messages – ostensibly from moderators of large subreddits – in which they are told that they've won a gift card, a cash prize, or a robotic ferret. (I may have made that last one up.) Anyway, we wanted to take a moment to inform everyone of the following:  **If you receive a private message telling you that you've won something, it is a scam.**  There are a number of ways that illicit accounts operate on Reddit. More often than not, spammers pump up their karma scores until they're past a certain threshold, then either sell their accounts or start submitting links to malware-infested websites and shady retail outlets. ([This brief guide](https://redd.it/3jss04) will tell you how to spot them... and if that's too long for you, [this tongue-in-cheek video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) will offer the same information.)  More recently, though, we've seen this new breed of parasite making the rounds. They register usernames that look like they could be associated with various Reddit communities (provided that you don't examine their profile pages too closely), then they contact users directly, thereby bypassing most of what moderators can do to combat them. If you receive one of their messages, here's what to do:  1. Do not click any of the links that it provides. 2. [Report the account to the administrators](https://www.reddit.com/report). 3. Block the account in question.  Remember, everyone, if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.  That's why we don't have robotic ferrets yet, sadly.	1748	root

gaming	What are you playing Wednesday!	ftktk88	Kadekito	Valorant. It's a pretty nice shooter when you like csgo but you're also extra as hell and maybe bored.  On the other side it has partly a toxic community as it literally combines the communities of csgo and league of legends and also game breaking things like you crash and get a 1 hour ban for it because you left the game mid match which is really ridiculous.  But it's still fun to play if the uneven matchmaking doesn't kill your mood right off.  Did I mention that you will have to suffer for 45 minutes when you get into an uneven match where you're being stepped on?  Yeah great game still somehow	1	h09lvi

Slowly but surely.  Games like this can feel a bit overwhelming at first and I don't like giving ground, but overall I can see myself spending just as much time with this as I have other games in the Total War series.  Will probably play a bit more of my campaign when I get home from work in the morning.	1	h09lvi

Ironcially one of the issues we were having was the switch to having paper ballots alongside the digital cards. One of the first people who voted at 7:30AM this morning ""rolled' their paper ballot printout up and then when they stuck it in the scanning machine it jammed it up. It delayed everyone 45+ minutes. Other people were grabbing the paper print out as soon as it ejected from the printer instead of waiting for the paper to get sucked back in to print on the other side, so it was messing with the machines. There's a lot of ratfuckery going on, but there's also a lot of user error.   Another theory is that some of the more ""Seasoned"" (E.g. elderly) poll workers aren't working right now because of coronavirus, so there's a lot of green workers who aren't sure of all the processes.

Sanders suspended his campaign and the RNC pledged full backing to Trump, both of the nominees are still simply the presumptive nominees.   What Sanders aims to do is to try and gather delegates in order to push Biden’s campaign to the left, but with so many rumblings that GOP elected officials throughout the Federal chambers are going rogue on Trump, Biden can speak all he wants. If he rolls out his “Republicans for Biden” coalition after the convention and republican support considerably aids Biden in thrashing Trump in the EC, Biden’s got to play ball with them, which means nothing substantially good for my community.	-4	fti4yo9

politics	Discussion Thread: Presidential and State Primaries (GA, NV, ND, SC, WV)	ftix3ny	hausofgnl	There are several factors. Covid precautions are adding extra time to every step of every process and that time adds up quickly. Georgia has switched to a new type of voting machine that prints out a paper ballot that is then scanned and kept. At my polling station there is only one scanner, after voting we all had to wait again for the scanner. Those new steps add time also, as well as voters having to learn the new system.   Then there are the problems I can’t explain. Machines not working, multiple precincts being combined without being given enough machines for the increase in voters, machines being delivered uncharged with back up batteries uncharged as well and machines being delivered to polling stations late. I don’t know how much of this are honest mistakes and how much is Republican suppression tactics.   My experience today was easy but I’ve heard of people waiting up to 9 hours to vote. Which is absurd.	4	ftigx9w

Even if he were overwhelmingly popular here, the state government routinely screws over Atlanta voters and makes them wait anywhere from 3-7 hours to get their ballots in.

politics	Discussion Thread: Presidential and State Primaries (GA, NV, ND, SC, WV)	fthzfu2	tweakingforjesus	Technically yes but practically no.  * I scanned and sent in my absentee ballot request via scanned email attachment to the county election board on 5/11, as described on the paper form sent me by the Secretary of State.   * As of 5/24 they had not yet received it.  I contacted my county commissioner about it.  She sent my request to the head of the department of elections.  By 5/26 my ballot request was marked received and then ballot issued. * I received the paper ballot in the mail on 6/4. * I dropped it in the collection box on 6/8.  The only reason I received my ballot was because I complained to my county commissioner.  And the only reason I knew to do that was through my neighborhood planning unit meeting.  Reports are that for some reason Fulton county decided to process emailed absentee ballot requests last.  As a result many people who emailed their requests early did not receive a ballot and are waiting in line to vote.  But the county reduced the number of voting locations because lower in person turnout was expected.  The secretary of state sent out  a ballot request to every voter in the state and it was expected that most people would vote this way.  But because Fulton county  screwed up the processing and did not send them out, we have a higher than expected in-person turnout.    People have currently been waiting in line up to 6 hours.  It is crazy.	15	fthtu2e

Joe Manchin is actually in a similar place right now.

If the states *can* continue to mandate that electors vote for the winner of the state’s popular vote, then the dead candidate becomes president-elect and on January 20th, in the absence of the President-elect, the Vice President becomes President.   If electors cannot be bound to voting for a dead candidate, then whoever receives 270 would be president. It would be assumed that the electors who would have voted for the dead candidate would all vote for the same new person - likely the vice presidential candidate. Otherwise, the House decides like normally laid out in the Constitution.	1	fthuq08

Federal officials found evidence that Trump had refused to rent to black tenants and lied to black applicants about whether apartments were available, among other accusations. Trump said the federal government was trying to get him to rent to welfare recipients. In the aftermath, he signed an agreement in 1975 agreeing not to discriminate to renters of color without admitting to discriminating before.  1980s: Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump’s Castle, accused another one of Trump’s businesses of discrimination. “When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,” Brown said. “It was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: They put us all in the back.”  1988: In a commencement speech at Lehigh University, Trump spent much of his speech accusing countries like Japan of “stripping the United States of economic dignity.” This matches much of his current rhetoric on China.  1989: In a controversial case that’s been characterized as a modern-day lynching, four black teenagers and one Latino teenager — the “Central Park Five” — were accused of attacking and raping a jogger in New York City. Trump immediately took charge in the case, running an ad in local papers demanding, “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” The teens’ convictions were later vacated after they spent seven to 13 years in prison, and the city paid $41 million in a settlement to the teens. But Trump in October 2016 said he still believes they’re guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary.  1991: A book by John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a black accountant: “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” Trump at first denied the remarks, but later said in a 1997 Playboy interview that “the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.”  1992: The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had to pay a $200,000 fine because it transferred black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a big-time gambler’s prejudices.  1993: In congressional testimony, Trump said that some Native American reservations operating casinos shouldn’t be allowed because “they don’t look like Indians to me.”  2000: In opposition to a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in Atlantic City, Trump secretly ran a series of ads suggesting the tribe had a “record of criminal activity [that] is well documented.”  2004: In season two of The Apprentice, Trump fired Kevin Allen, a black contestant, for being overeducated. “You’re an unbelievably talented guy in terms of education, and you haven’t done anything,” Trump said on the show. “At some point you have to say, ‘That’s enough.’”  2005: Trump publicly pitched what was essentially The Apprentice: White People vs. Black People. He said he “wasn’t particularly happy” with the most recent season of his show, so he was considering “an idea that is fairly controversial — creating a team of successful African Americans versus a team of successful whites. Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world.”  2010: In 2010, there was a huge national controversy over the “Ground Zero Mosque” — a proposal to build a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, near the site of the 9/11 attacks. Trump opposed the project, calling it “insensitive,” and offered to buy out one of the investors in the project. On The Late Show With David Letterman, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, “Well, somebody’s blowing us up. Somebody’s blowing up buildings, and somebody’s doing lots of bad stuff.”  2011: Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama’s birth certificate. Obama later released his birth certificate, calling Trump a ”carnival barker.” (The research has found a strong correlation between “birtherism,” as this conspiracy theory is called, and racism.) Trump has reportedly continued pushing this conspiracy theory in private.  2011: While Trump suggested that Obama wasn’t born in the US, he also argued that maybe Obama wasn’t a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts. Trump claimed, “I heard he was a terrible student. Terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?”  I don't want to be hostile, I genuinely just want people to understand how long he's been spewing garbage.	11	ftjgn2d

politics	Discussion Thread: Presidential and State Primaries (GA, NV, ND, SC, WV)	ftioolo	Soyuz_Wolf	You’re asking about election math there.   It’s entirely possible for a candidate to win with a minority vote, especially with multiple candidates running. The DNC is supposed to avoid this with delegates and now the two round voting with the supers in the second round at the convention (if no candidate amassed more than the required amount in the first round).   It also happens quite frequently in countries with parliamentary systems and coalition governments. No party reaches the required seats to hold office so they must form coalitions etc   Anyway to answer your question, in a perfect world obviously not, and the only way to avoid this is FPTP in theory (and ideally not land based votes lol), but even that doesn’t avoid it (welcome to 2016), and then you end up with a two party system in which neither candidate truly represents anyone’s interests that much but you have to vote strategically.   So, it’s complicated? Ideally no, in practice, it depends.   There’s a number of alternatives that again help avoid having candidates that don’t represent the majority, but we’re stuck with FPTP so that’s that.   But I’m not sure why you’re going with such a loaded question when I already said I don’t disagree in the first place.	0	ftinu1w

For the month of February, it looked like Sanders had a favorite's shot at the nomination. As soon as Biden picked up steam in SC, he pulled far ahead and never looked back. Helps that he got a swath of last minute endorsements before Super Tuesday, but the momentum was swinging that way regardless and I think the results would have been similar if not so lopsided. And even if his opponents waited until after ST to drop, the clean sweep of states like my home state of Michigan (a state Sanders won in 2016) likely would have played out the same way.	2	fti44kq

So, when Biden made it clear that he had the support of the Democratic machine in it's entirety, the pragmatic voters followed their lead. Black voters tend to be really pragmatic. They don't have the privilege that allows for idealism.   Biden's campaign showed people that he was the leader of the Party. And the United States needs a President that can get things done.

Of course we end up often choosing an election winner with a minority vote. A primary is a little different because it doesn’t even require a vote, a candidate just needs to be chosen through the process. And also, my question is kind of philosophical as opposed to practical or theoretical. Should a candidate be chosen if they represent the majority of the voters? Probably. But maybe not, maybe the voters are wrong, or they don’t know what they want or whatever.	0	ftioolo

politics	Discussion Thread: Presidential and State Primaries (GA, NV, ND, SC, WV)	ftj4eul	chownrootroot	I suppose, but also there are situations where the voters might choose someone who they shouldn’t, like imagine someone isn’t actually old enough to be president or born outside of the country or whatever, and imagine they somehow win the primary. Well the party should probably make it clear they can’t be the nominee no matter what otherwise they’re throwing the election. But perhaps that’s too much of an edge case.  I do think a primary should not be a popularity contest, and not an elite insider, uh, choice? But rather, it’s good to have some mixture of the two, some compromise between different factions and voters and insiders, etc. Listening to 538’s podcasts on primaries it sounds best to have a revolving regional system where voters in certain regions vote on certain dates, with the dates rotating each election. This removes the specificity of Iowa and NH choosing the candidate, but it still is a “race”, meaning the candidates will need to offer themselves to different voter groups and work to get their votes. If you just have a vote and the biggest pile of votes wins then it’s just a popularity contest and you could have voters do a Donald Trump and the dark horse wins and then that sucks.  Superdelegates on the other hand are a different issue. They only vote on the 2nd round if there is no majority in the first round (and subsequent rounds). I would guess it’s a good idea because the idea of the convention is to build a consensus with a majority of the party as opposed to just giving every thing to the plurality winner who might be a factional candidate and not represent the majority. You could probably make arguments either way on superdelegates.	1	ftj1x1k

CasualUK	Wednesday Wins Wthread [10 June 2020]	ftk8qpe	Braythor_	Yes I have a win, and listen up cos it could help you out and give you your own win. I worked out that I overpaid my student loan last year by about £170, so gonna ring them up and get that refunded. I've done this before and it's a totally pain free experience. So for those that don't know here's the thing:  Student loan payments have an annual threshold, like tax does, but it also has monthly and weekly thresholds. However unlike tax, if you earn loads one week/month, you pay based on how much you went over the threshold with that pay, but it doesn't balance itself out in future wages. In order to get the money back, you have to ring them after the tax year and, assuming HMRC have done your calculations for the year, they do a quick check comparing your annual pay to the annual threshold, then if you have overpaid they refund you. They can go back a few years as well.  So for anyone who has not been on a steady regular income (especially people on zero hours/weekly pay), it's worth giving them a call. I think all you need is your NI number and student finance no.	5	h04qu0

At the time there were _no_ darker skinned Fairies in the issue's album in the FB group, and only three with ""fantasy"" skin colours (my 2nd and 3rd images, plus one more ""Simpsons yellow"" Fairy). Since I put my Forest Harp image into the group, a few other images have been posted with darker skinned Fairies.  After all, who says that Fairies are all _white_?"	5	h04qu0

If we keep him up too late he gets overtired and just cries for hours so we don’t want to risk that. He gets up and has a change of nappy and a bottle and goes back to sleep for a few hours.

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftk8u5k	KungFuPup	Finished **NieR: Automata**. Enjoyed the story a lot. Was interesting as I had no idea what it was about at first having never read anything about it  Played a little bit of **Minecraft Dungeons**. It's pretty basic but fun. Was annoyed that there was a bug after we spent about 40 minutes doing a level and now we have to start again.  **Lego games**. My daughter wanted to play with me so we set up some Lego games to play together. I set the Xbox controllers up with co-pilot and she does all the button presses for me while I move us around. She's having a great time.	7	h05b6w

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkelpk	themakeupgoblin	Playing loads of animal crossing lately.  I finally got switch online now that some of my friends have a switch and it means I've got access to other people's custom designs.    I'm currently in the process of building a hiking trail and some flower gardens to expand my hybrids.    Also been playing a lot of GTA 5 but mostly just driving around and spending time in the mountains.  I'm really missing going outside I think.	4	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkguul	povabilly	Played **D&D** on Monday and finally managed to kill something, for the time since I killed another PC in September. Only some gnolls, but it's better than nothing.  I discovered that **Mafia II Remastered** was in my steam library the other day, so played that for a bit. I'm enjoying it but cars handle like rollerskates on an ice rink and the music is wrong.  Got the new **Europa Universalis IV** DLC, so I had an hour or so on that last night and they've added a shit ton of new stuff to try and get my head round.  I've also got a **Cities: Skylines** base game key if anyone wants it. Got the complete collection on humble bundle and already had it	4	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkhlzm	RhipWolf	I do enjoy this thread!   Been playing Warzone mostly. I am nowhere near good enough to win but im getting close purely by hiding all game.

He simulates a PES5/(6?) season and pretends to be the manager along with all the assistant managers in the chat. Proper laugh.	4	h05b6w

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftk91p2	Send_Serotonin	Still playing mostly Warzone. Pretty bored of the multiplayer now after unlocking damascus. SBM makes it really difficult to get a good game. The good old days of pub-stomping are over for me. :(  I did buy Skate 2 & 3 for ps3 and have been playing Skate 2 a little hear and there. Much harder than I remember 3 being all those years ago.  Also found my old Guitar Hero games, but no controller so I bought one of those. Finding it very bloody hard lol.  Ooo and The Last of Us pt. 2 next week!	3	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftk9hw8	glimmerousdream	I’ve been playing Dragon Quest 11 on ps4 this week and I am really loving it. The story has grasped me more than any other game in a long time, and I really like it being turn based combat as I have time to think strategically. I’ve just made it to the mini medal academy, which is as delightfully weird as expected.   Also still sinking a fair bit of time into Animal Crossing. I’m trying to make little improvements to my island so it looks a little better. I’m beginning to get a bit burned out with ideas though because I’m not particularly creative.	3	h05b6w

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkbe2n	Spangles64	Dragon Age Inquisition PS4 grabbed on sale for just under £7.00 while browsing the PSN store purely out of boredom and curiosity as reviews seemed good. And what an investment it's been, with a mix of Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings type fantasy storyline. Great characters and voice acting in a beautifully rendered vast world, I'd definitely recommend it to any fans of the genre.	3	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkczbm	Mukatsukuz	Got into Cities: Skylines. I used to love SimCity and SimCity 2000. I didn't like the missions in SimCity 4 and the latest one felt bland, so I've been itching for a good city builder. Anno is ok but you place everything manually so it doesn't feel organic, Tropico has too much of the p word in it and Cities: Skylines has never managed to hold my interest... until now.   I've started watching tutorials and adding a few basic mods to it and this makes me realise I hadn't grasped the depth of it. I remember the first time I loaded it that I was annoyed there was no random map generator but now I see how big the maps are and how many are on the Workshop, this no longer bothers me. The game is great and just had (sorry, past tense) a big bundle with most of the DLC on Humble Bundle.	3	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkdocb	jptoc	Won a warzone solo yesterday with 7 kills, came 3rd in a quad with a few friends.   Quite pleased with that! Not been playing much else to be honest. I went back to play some normal team death matches on COD/Battlefront and I don't get anywhere near the same enjoyment from it. The tense atmosphere of the elimination style games are so much better.	3	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkeepa	Shockwavepulsar	Apex Legends mostly for me. Oh and I’m replaying RDR2 and treating it as a hunting simulator. I’m mostly holding out for Last of Is 2 though.	3	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkfok0	HairyMechanic	I said last week i'd got away from **Football Manager 2020** but I honestly haven't, sunk another half season in the last week.  I bought **Europa Universalis IV** a couple of weeks ago but have yet to play it. I don't mind in depth games but it's going to take a couple of hours to understand all of the HUD information as there looks like there's quite a lot of it! Any tips?	3	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkm8tm	drunkemonkee	Guild Wars 2.   Not played in years, I'm hooked in once again. Something about these games is addictive.	3	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkn4vr	Squidco-2658	I decided to start playing The Last of Us after giving up on it due to difficulty, and I am so pleased, it’s genuinely become one of my favourite games and a welcome distraction after getting into a crisis after doing virtual exams.	3	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkpsr5	Babinian	I've just started playing Witcher 2 - completed Witcher 3 in 2016/2017 (I think) and loved it but had assumed the older ones wouldn't be as enjoyable. I was totally wrong! The graphics obviously aren't quite as beautiful as the newest one, but it looks surprisingly good and controls aren't too hard. Only a few hours in so far but looking forward to doing a couple of hours in the evening on it for the next few weeks!	3	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkt18l	1_player	I've received all the parts for my new beefy PC, except the CPU (i9 10900k), no ETA in sight. Feels bad man.  Also received the prescription lens adapters for my Index from VROptician, one week for Deutsche Post/Royal Mail to deliver, but happy it's here. I'll probably spend the evening with my VR headset on trying out the new Automobilista 2 patch or ACC.	3	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkg4zk	TrojanGoldfish	Finally got round to getting properly sunk into **Horizon Zero Dawn**, after bouncing off the opening couple of hours a few times. Damn it's good once the story gets going.  Very little original design in terms of gameplay (open world, third person action game with light stealth elements, 'towers' to unlock the map, collectables, etc etc). But excellent environmental world building, a surprisingly good story, and occasionally breathtaking graphics. And Lance Reddick, who always makes everything a little bit better.  Feel like I'm heading toward the end of the story quest, so it's time to settle into the side quests and exploring. Also need to go and have words with that Thunderjaw that kicked my shoes off early on.	5	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftk7thr	Braythor_	Been at a loose end with games, not wanted to start anything because Last of Us 2 is out next week so I wouldn't have time to go through most games by then. Shame, cos Death Stranding is on sale for £25 on PSN.   So while browsing the sale, ended up buying Thumper for £4, played a couple of levels on the VR and it's pretty damn good. Kind of a rhythm based game, can't really compare it to anything except maybe Rez but that's unfair cos...well it's Rez. But yeah, fun.	2	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftk85df	outline01	Hello, fellow gamergeeks of CasualUK!   Tbh, I'm still just playing the same two monster games - **Monster Hunter World** and **Monster Train**.   MHW has just grabbed me this time around. Base game didn't do much but Iceborne *clicked* and I absolutely love it. I've pretty much maxed everything out on my Charge Blade builds and am just playing around with different weapons.   Monster Train is like a follow-up to Slay the Spire and I do really like it. I'm not as charmed as I was by StS but I've put in good hours and keep coming back to it. Lots to do, each run is different... Very fun game.

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftk9j9y	LittleCrunchyDude	Remnant: from the ashes dlc just released on ps so getting back into that - my criminally underrated game of last year. Found out that having bought hohokum on PS3 years ago I also own it on PS4, so I've also been a rainbow worm thing to calm down.  I've also been enjoying the decidedly un-British version of world war 2 that cod created. It's like Michael bay directed it. It is very stupid, but mechanically sound and free on ps+, so why not grab a beer and smoke and pretend to be an American. Yehaw, war.	2	h05b6w

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkh7pv	Milky1985	Playing C and C remastered on PC and Xenoblade Chronicles DE on Switch.  I had to check about C and C and i was correct in thinking the game was harder than i remember, they made some AI changes that make things that were already a bit tough even harder. Cleared the NOD missions though so don't have to deal with the utterly deadly Airstrikes that are useless when used in the GDI campaign.  Just gotta deal with physic flamethrower troops that somehow know they are about to be run over :P  But Kanes time is almost up! just a few missions to go before his temple gets ion cannoned.	2	h05b6w

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkhref	neema_t	Finally finished my 3-year-old Watch Dogs 2 save, posted about it on r/patientgamers so won't go into it again but that was before I finished it - man was the ending poor and I found absolutely no reason to keep playing so I uninstalled it.  So I went from that to another really old save, Mirror's Edge (save created in September 2011), which I have a hate/hate relationship with - in that I hate the story but also hate everything else about the game - but feel compelled to finish so I can uninstall it. It just annoys me how it's all about keeping your momentum going, but will occasionally trap you in a tiny room with no obvious route out so you end up trying stuff that doesn't seem like it would work, but because Faith can just defy physics at will it *does* work. Except for the bit I tried and failed like 20 times over last night.  Not sure what to move onto next when I finish it. Do I play Hellblade (which started off really well but then I encountered a puzzle that stumped me and I couldn't be bothered to watch a YouTube video to learn what I'm supposed to do), Ruiner, Dishonoured (again picking up a years old save) or maybe Prey (which I've failed to get into twice)?	2	h05b6w
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkhtbz	gemmegg	Red Dead Redemption 2 on the PC. Played it before on thr PS4 but wanted to see it in glorious 4k as i have a first gen ps4.   Loving it again, not looking forward to the end. I had an weird issue with artefacts that made me worry my gpu was on the out but apparently it’s fairly common for RDR2 and i’ve sorted it now.   I’ve given up on animal crossing. Feel a bit burnt out by it all.   Excited for last of us 2 to come out, might preorder.	2	h05b6w

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkp74k	Hyphenater	I snatched up a copy of *Gathering Storm* for Civ VI (£25, because I steam let me buy the platinum edition bundle even though *GS* was the only thing in it I didn't have). I would definitely recommend it to any Civ VI fans out there, especially as there's a huge amount more in it than just the climate change mechanics (though those are quite nice).  I also elevated my nerd status a step higher by buying my first submarine simulator over the weekend, which was a copy of *UBOAT*. It's been a lot of fun so far, especially as the game is designed to be accessible to new players without sacrificing too much depth.  Last weekend's *D&D* summary: We got ambushed in the town square by a dragon, Wizard nearly got clawed to death, Fighter nearly got frozen to death, and I got munched on and passed out. Thankfully it decided to piss off after that. We then went to a mine, where all the other party members tried to convince the family of Wererats there to work for the mine owner.  After finding out that they had actually murdered the original workers and taken the place for themselves, we ended up getting trapped in a tunnel and had to fight them. Fun fact: you cannot physically harm lycanthropes with normal weapons, they have to be enchanted or silvered, so my rogue character with only normal weapons and no magic had to improvise a little. I ended up having to pick up oil lanterns off the wall and throw them at the Wererats and stole a number of enchanted arrows from our Hunter's quiver, as well as scattering ball bearings down a tunnel to make a trap like I was starring in Home Alone. We survived that, killed a carrion crawler that nearly ate our wizard, murdered a lot of rats, and finally reached 4th level. Can't wait for next week!	2	h05b6w

I used to play Cod4 and Cod MW2 loads back at secondary school and didnt like any of the releases since so MW is the first COD I've played since then and it could be my favourite, which is saying alot considering COD4 and MW2.  I play with a team for demolition and other objective game types as I find the teamwork and tactics far more fun than just running around trying to rack up kills.     I'm looking for people to play demolition and others for teamwork, if you can tell the team where you got shot from, which bombsite you're defending and where you think the bulk of the enemy team are please come and join the team!  **You don't have to be good!** I prefer to build a team from working together to improve rather than snobbishly find already very good players.     I have a 19 win streak, \~0.97K/D, and don't take it too seriously. I try to win as a team, but if we lose it doesn't matter. Less screaming and shouting and more laughing :)     I play on PC and my Activision ID is ""RupertSmythe#3081438"" (not my real name lol, I chose it on WarThunder as a WW2 pilot name)  We're looking for players on PS4/Xbox/PC  ADD ME!

Started WoL yesterday early evening, and just finished it an hour ago-11 hours of great fun.  I blinked and the sun was coming up lol.  So later on will be Heart of the Swarm.  I'm in 2 minds about hitting ranked though as I utterly suck at it and ranked anxiety is a real bitch-and I've not been on ranked for 3+ years now.  And did some training modes earlier and my APM has taken a massive hit (down from over 100 to mid 30s).  I'm also debating wether or not to buy Total War: Warhammer, and Total War: Warhammer 2 at the moment, as they're both on sale for £8.66 and £11.33 respectively.  I'm very tempted as I enjoy strategy games a lot.	1	h05b6w

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftk9bdr	9DAN2	Skate 3 and guitar hero are some of my all time favourite games. I still play skate 3, and made sure to buy all the DLC again when it became backwards comparable.   Although the older guitar hero games are superior, especially GH3, I was actually shit hot on GH live, found myself in the top 10 in the leaderboards of a lot of songs, before the servers were closed.   For a fan of skate, I really recommend STEEP. It’s winter sports and it’s very similar gameplay to skate. A massive open world in the mountains, with challenges scattered. Just like skate, you can find a spot you like and repeat the same line over and over without getting bored.	2	ftk91p2

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftki8qv	neema_t	The free copy of Portal they offered when Steam for Mac launched ended up costing me probably about £8-10k over the past ten years in games, PCs and peripherals. I never had a Windows PC as a kid, so when Steam showed me pretty much *all the games* I always wanted to play but couldn't (and still couldn't, with the Mac I had) I kind of went off the deep end for a few years.  I think I've got it reasonably under control now, but for some people Steam is a very slippery slope.	2	ftk9qe2

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkpybd	Hyphenater	"I would heartily recommend the tresspasser DLC if you haven't gotten it yet. The others give you a bit of interesting extra content, but tresspasser really adds to the ending. I've played at least 400 hrs of *Origins* so far, and I can say for certain that it has very good re-playability even for an RPG. It's probably my favourite game of the last decade.  For the other games in the series, you can try them out to get a better idea of the overall story but being fairly old games (especially *Origins*) they can be a bit of a nightmare to play as they have that ""old-school"" difficulty and complexity to them."	2	ftkbe2n
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkfjuo	HairyMechanic	That's the joy of C:S and the big maps - there's no real end goal unless you set yourself one (e.g. population).

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkj3ay	BangaiBangai	I like normal TDM style multiplayer if I'm good at it. I'm not good at Modern Warfare.  I find that the 20 games of Warzone I play where we get stomped is all worthwhile for when you have that one game where you get loads of kills or win outright. Having one good game in normal MP isn't the same.  That said Warzone is getting a bit stale with everyone using the Grau 100% of the time and it being outright the best gun to use almost all the time.	2	ftkdocb
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkri6l	80sWasteman	"Watch EUIV ""Let's play"" or similar on YouTube.

Treat it as a role-playing game. The only way to win in the game is world domination but it's unrealistic to do this and most people don't ever finish their games. Instead, pick a nation and have an idea of how you want to play - survival, expansion, some historical revisionism etc and enjoy. Similar to FM2020, if you get knocked back a few times keep going until you get bored and then start another campaign."	1	ftkfok0

The story is mostly irrelevant but the gameplay is one of the most fluid and enjoyable gaming experiences I can recall. Some of it leans more into puzzle admittedly, but I enjoyed that break - it meant the game wasn't just ""Hold forward and press jump sometimes""   Watch Dogs is an interesting one, I'm definitely quite tempted as I skipped both games when they came out.

A very engaging storyline, sometimes I find hard to follow as it is the third in the series and I haven't played the others but that doesn't detract from it being a solid game in itself. Can't remember the last game that made me carry on thinking about it after I turned it off. It has helped me through many hours of this lockdown and I feel lucky to have discovered it, especially at that price with some free dlc too.	3	ftkdmes
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkugkn	Spangles64	I've never considered a game of this type on console before, only ever on PC in the past with the last title similar to it being Neverwinter but it's been a gem of a find at the price paid and I will consider the dlc once completed. Everyone seems to rate Trespasser as the best one so I'm looking forward to that. So far I've managed to avoid spoilers and only looked for tips when completely stuck. It's a huge game for sure and to give you an idea of where I'm up to, I haven't fought a dragon yet but have seen them. Should be interesting.	2	ftkpybd

They have mentors who will show you the ropes and there are guides on setting TTS up and getting an army together.  It's slow mind, you'll need a couple of hours for small games.

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkm0yc	neema_t	"I dunno, maybe it's just that I'm playing it now rather than back when it was new, but everything about Mirror's Edge just bugs me and makes me hate it. It was good early on but the later stages just piss me off more than anything I can remember, for example the bit I got stuck on last night involved wall running to a pipe, jump to another pipe, jump to an AC unit, wall run to something hanging off a crane and then there's another thing hanging from the crane and a door with gaps too big to jump in between. I kept failing because Faith wouldn't wall run, then she couldn't make the jump from the second pipe to the AC unit, then she ""tripped"" (bounced off some geometry, I guess) when making the first jump, then I almost made it but she couldn't grab the thing hanging off the crane... I guess it's just really, really annoying knowing what you need to do but the controls are too pedantic to let you just *do* it.  Edit: I will admit it's satisfying when you get stuck, take a break, come back and see exactly what you're supposed to do, but I'm still quite sure that if someone were to ask me what the game's greatest strengths are I'd say a) it's short and b) I've almost finished it.  You won't need to hunt long to find that post, check my profile, it's the last post I made. It's mainly about how I prefer it to GTA V which is somehow still the de facto open world crime game. I personally think WD2 is superior as far as the singleplayer game goes (the story *is* pretty bad, though, but so is GTA V's IMO)."	2	ftkks4a

Good timing as well as I was getting burnt out from too much Overwatch.  I wouldn't mind getting back into the MP part of it, but I'd need to practice to get my APM back up.  If it doesn't work out it doesn't work out.  Plus my favourite race to play right now is Protoss, and their lategame right now is in a bad way-plus ofc the Terran Widowmine buff went through.  How fun lol.	2	ftk9ooj

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftk9uai	9DAN2	The Danny Ways Hawaiian dream is the best DLC, shame nobody else plays it online. Iv owner the game on 360, PS3 and Xbox one on my new account. It’s a game I always have to have in my library. I’d love a remastered version or a skate 4.   Once you get the hang of that orange button, the move from hard-expert is nothing compared to medium-hard.	1	ftk9nty
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkegm1	KungFuPup	> as it is the third in the series.  Origins is the first game. Then dragon age 2 and then Inquisition. It's a decent long game though that should keep you busy for a long time.	2	ftke5ia
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkrrw9	BangaiBangai	"It's the best AR at mid range (ie. almost all Warzone engagements not indoors) and is probably the best at longer range too.  It doesn't make you a mug to prefer a non meta gun, I've played loads of games where I've done much better than using a gun that is ""objectively"" better, but it is a problem if the choice of gun to use becomes so slanted that everyone uses it. It's pretty boring if 99% of the people you come up against are just using the Grau, even if you don't use it yourself.   My mate last night had a Grau class and after killing someone picked up their MP5 as a secondary, only to 2 minutes later realise he'd made a mistake and now he was running round with two Graus - a perfect summary for the meta at the minute."	1	ftkr4d7
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkp6vm	sideone	"I really enjoyed WD2, but got completely stuck at the point where you need to storm the police station. The ""ethical hacker"" main character never sat right with ""gun all the police down"" but never managed to sneak in stealthily."	2	ftkm0yc
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkc4tu	KungFuPup	Nope can't choose I'm afraid. But you could just ask them to leave one bit alone so you can do the steering for them. Mine is 3 so she struggles to do 2 parts at once so she sticks with hitting the buttons for me based on their colour :)  [Eurogamer article on it as the official site is down right now.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.eurogamer.net/amp/2017-01-23-xbox-ones-upcoming-co-pilot-feature-will-let-two-players-share-one-controller)	2	ftkbf4v

CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkd2co	Send_Serotonin	I loved that DLC, the black park out towards the back was really fun. I quite enjoyed the free one in the dark, the name slips my mind. Skate 4 is the dream but I doubt it'll ever happen.  I haven't played for a couple weeks but I do need to give it some more practice. I had almost finished One by Metallica (on hard) and ended up losing at something like 94%. That was the last time I played it.	2	ftk9uai
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkfpn6	Spangles64	Damn, you are so right, it is Inquisition that I'm playing. Having a 'Dohhh' moment right now and I've not long woken up. Well that's my excuse anyway lol, cheers I'll edit my original post, thanks for pointing it out.	2	ftkegm1
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkr4zr	neema_t	"I think my problems with WD2 would've been solved if they leaned on the other definitions of ""hacking"" and gave us more non-lethal gadgets like you see in Splinter Cell and MGS V. And the melee attack in WD2 is lethal, even the recent Deus Ex games give you the option for a non-lethal takedown and in that you play as a guy who has swords in his arms and can have an array of grenade launchers implanted in his torso..."	2	ftkp6vm
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkg1nd	KungFuPup	Hah no worries. I never know what's going on most days. My favourite character was The Iron Bull. I was a warrior tank but I still often took him with me as I found him really funny.	2	ftkfpn6
CasualUK	WASDnesday 10/6/2	ftkhwu0	Spangles64	The last time I played anything similar to this was Neverwinter Nights (another Bioware game I think) on PC years ago. I usually play casual shooters like COD in short sessions, but having so much time to kill these days I wish I'd found this game sooner, it has helped me cope with the boredom and I'll probably get into the first 2 after this.	2	ftkg1nd

FuckYouKaren	Sorry for the furry porn, it appears that the subreddit was hijacked and all moderators were removed.	frei5qg	Pope_Cerebus	"You're the one who immediately started saying furries all dress in fursuits and most of them want to fuck cartoons. Which is on its face combative and dismissive, as well as being uninformed and wildly inaccurate.  Then you tried claiming that's not something very many anime fans want to do. Anime - the fandom that has demanded sexualizing of characters in all their shows - ones focusing on young teens included - to the point where they coined the term ""fanservice"" to describe it. How many anime shows can you name that don't have either blatant sex, an unnatural obsession with one or more characters' breast size, an episode dedicated to all the girls getting naked at a public bath / hot spring, or some character whose entire personality can be summed up as ""lecherous""? Off the top of my head, I can think of only one out of dozens of anime series I've seen: Madoka Magica (and even that has outfits on the girls that would be questionable IRL).  Now, let's compare that to furry media, where it's pretty much the opposite. Off the top of my head, I can only think of a single example that includes those things - Beastars, which is itself an anime."	4	frec5vq

FuckYouKaren	Sorry for the furry porn, it appears that the subreddit was hijacked and all moderators were removed.	frbpro9	L1LYFL0W3R	"Not all furries, including me, participate in NSFW ""activities"" in the community in fact most of them don't. Its just a community that has gotten a really bad reputation from the people that do. Youre letting one bad side of the community ruin the whole thing for you. Its just a bunch of people that like to draw furries and dress up and have fun. Do you think cosplaying is kinky? Loving anime is kinky? Its just a Fandom that likes to express themselves and there's nothing wrong with it. People make everything kinky i don't see why it has to be so much worse when its furries? Lmao im not trying to turn you into a furry or anything but you are only focusing on the negative things.I highly recommend learning more about the good side of the community, the majority of us are all really nice and accepting people. :)"	2	frbp1de

FuckYouKaren	Sorry for the furry porn, it appears that the subreddit was hijacked and all moderators were removed.	frbtbdb	alienturkey9958	Aight I do see your point, but I'm just saying it's not something that the general populace would feel comfortable seeing. I also see your point about only seeing the negative part of the community, but that's because they are the ones who do this shit. It makes it a lot harder to dismiss it as just the minority when its pretty much the only time most people experience the community itself, because most of the good people you speak of do tend to stay to their community. I also just gonna clarify this I not trying to shit on what you like to do I'm just saying take into account how it makes other people feel when you do flaunt it around like that.	2	frbpro9

FuckYouKaren	Sorry for the furry porn, it appears that the subreddit was hijacked and all moderators were removed.	frbyrfs	Pope_Cerebus	"Your argument is that people don't see the community as normal, because the normal people stick to themselves. But then, you say they should keep doing that rather than risk anyone seeing them - which just perpetuates the problem you just admitted existed. The only way to solve the problem is for ""normal"" furries to make themselves more visible.  Also, just to point out, you keep using the word ""flaunt"" in a context that marks it as derogatory. You're saying *any* display of the furry fandom outside of designated ""furry areas"" is bad. It's bigoted language. These are precisely the arguments used against gay people in the 80s and 90s when they'd given up trying to make it illegal again, but were still pushing it as some kind of moral outrage that people could freely admit they were gay in public, instead of hiding their shame in the bath houses like an acceptable deviant."	1	frbtbdb

FuckYouKaren	Sorry for the furry porn, it appears that the subreddit was hijacked and all moderators were removed.	frc1bcy	alienturkey9958	"Man I was going to avoid saying this the first time you made the comparison, but don't use what the lgbtq community went through to back up your point when you just called being a furry a hobby. Its like saying that lgbtq is just a hobby, which it is not obvious. Comparing something that is out of their control to a hobby is just out right demeaning, also don't try to pull the fucking you don't know what is like to be oppressed card while talking about being gay. I'm fucking black bi and live in the ghetto. They aren't exactly the most accepting community if you didn't know.  Second the word flaunt is not a bigoted word as you claim because if it was it would out right have a negative connotation, but it does not. Flaunting something has the connotation of showing off but in a more overtly flashy way, which is not a bad thing. I was using it in it's proper connotative meaning.  Another point I would like to make is that I'm not saying anything that is part of the furry fandom should be quarantined to furry areas. I said the things that makes other people uncomfortable should be such a yiff and fursuits. As you previously stated there are a fuck ton of things that should be classified as furry but aren't, like the anthropomorphic animal in the vast majority of cartoons. That's someone expressing themselves in a positive way without exposing others to discomfort. As I said I'm not trying to shit on you I'm saying try to take in consideration the majority.  I tried to talk to you and explain my point in a nice civilized way, which you did also at the start of this little conversation of ours, but after not bringing me to your point of view you started to call me a bigot. By your words not mine ""fursuiting is not a kink its a hobby "" which makes it not bigotry in the slightest as people are allowed to disprove of others hobbies. Step off your moral high horse and stop acting like I personally attacked you. I was just expressing my views like I'm allowed to, and you were expressing yours. Let's just agree to disagree and end this fucking farce. I have had enough of it already."	6	frbyrfs

FuckYouKaren	Sorry for the furry porn, it appears that the subreddit was hijacked and all moderators were removed.	frczr1m	Pope_Cerebus	"Not my words, either. Unless you think I'm running multiple accounts in this discussion, you're mixing up my comments with those of another poster.  However, you stated multiple times, and very bluntly in the above post, that ""yiff and fursuits"" should be ""quarantined"". That's basically saying, ""don't express your sexuality"" and ""don't express your identity."" And you just used the term ""quarantine"" like it's some sort of horrible disease. I'm not sure how that can be seen as anything other than offensive and oppressive.  Oh, and your dismissive attitude towards fursuits being a ""hobby"" is 100% a parallel to considering drag and trans as a ""hobby"". After all, they're both just putting on ""costumes"", right?  I'm not claiming furries have it anywhere near as bad as the LBGT community, but the language and attitudes I saw against that community throughout the 80s and 90s is the most direct parallel to what I've seen furries subjected to throughout the internet for the last 10 years. Your ""the majority doesn't like to see that, so keep it out of view"" attitude is exactly the same attitude that was used against the LGBT expressions then. It's the closest comparison that exists, right down to the wording you used.  So yes, I'll agree that I disagree with you. The fact that you're bi and oppressed does not mean you get to be the gatekeeper to define when others are being oppressed."	1	frc1bcy

Think about it like this I don't go flirting around with my straight guy friends which I'll could try and defend my actions by saying that I am expressing myself, because I know that they don't want that and it going to make them very uncomfortable. The yiff thing would be like me puting gay porn on this a subreddit like this one or sending it to my friends. It's not oppression sticking to the assigned places for it.	2	frczr1m

FuckYouKaren	Sorry for the furry porn, it appears that the subreddit was hijacked and all moderators were removed.	frdbesw	L1LYFL0W3R	I agree there is a time and a place for everything, If I were fortunate enough to own a fursuit I'd never go to a mall or something to fursuit just like its weird to go out in cosplay. But I also don't think we should just have to stick to conventions. We spend potentially thousands of dollars on a high quality suit and we are supposed to only wear it only a couple times a year at a convention IF you can go? I'd love for furries/fursuits to be more normalized even if it just ment for us to be seen in suits in parks, but I think thats just something that will happen over time as people become more aware and used to the culture!	4	frd7alu
